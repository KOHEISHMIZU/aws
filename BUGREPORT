User interface
* gl resource management (total resource size, used resource size)
* ap's control table smoother smoothing out monotonically as the control value.
* model parameter optimization
* simulator does not reduce rev as reduced control value
* short range router (and short range map consideration)
* exit button in sys
* log button in sys
* ais marker, box and line should be removed
* scales for rudder and engine are required
* depth should be indicated
* information for selected ais should be enlarged
* information for selected waypoint should be enlarged
* estimated current position of ais target should be indicated
* life time of 0 sog ais target should be extended
* cursor position should placed at fixed region
* The menu open/close markers are not sufficientlly sensitive. (larger size is prefered.)
* waypoint cannot be drugged.
* roll, pitch, yaw indicators should be on horizon related to camera parameter
* c_ui_box_manager should expanded in f_aws1_ui.
* f_aws1_ctrl should have test mode(run without actual zgpio device.)
* autopilot mode is changed to crz mode when joystic input is excited
* heartbeat check between aws1_ctrl and aws1_ui
  - if aws1_ctrl does not detect heartbeat from aws1_ui set all control to neutral
  - if aws1_ui does not detect heartbeat from aws1_ctrl indicate control error
* 

Util
* c_gl_2d_obj should support texture mapping

AIS decoder
* ships are vanished as time progress.

remote command
* Buffer overrun is not checked.

AWS sys
* when init_run failed, the state should be stopped and all filters started with init_run should be stopped by calling destroy_run

#### Solved
* in windows version, aws_mkdir is not working.
* Selected AIS object is not collect
* When waypoint is selected by mouse, menu box does not reflect the waypoint number selected.
* selected ais object is changed when the order of the object is changed.
* indicator draws a long line rolling with roll scale at the center.
* during dragging map, flickers are caused frequently.
* Menus and indicator are overwrapped with objects.
* Map cannot be back to the own-ship centered mode.
* chls command should show channel type
* map range scale should be 1000, 2000 ..., 10k, 20k, ...., 200k, 300k
* in map mode, circle masking layer is not working
* speed indicator should be text
